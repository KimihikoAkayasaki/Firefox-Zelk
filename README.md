# Firefox-Zelk
Firefox theme inspired by BD Zelk / ZorinOS

## Setup
- Go to `about:config` and set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `True`
- Open `about:support` and open the `Profile Folder`
- Create a new `chrome` folder there (backup current if already you have one)
- Put both `.css` files from the repo there
  
## Notes
For best results use `Compact` density in Firefox user settings.<br>
Note that this theme may be a bit buggy and it also overwrites<br>
the top part only. If you wanna have some fresh and nice experience,<br>
I'd reccommend using the `Sweet` or `Pop` theme. (Find 'em on GitHub)

## License
As this is only damn css and literally anyone could make this,<br>
please don't even think about *that thing*...
